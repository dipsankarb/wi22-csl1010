Presentation is an art and one of the most important communication skills for a researcher that can be developed over sincere practice. Methodical, concise and engaging presentation makes a big difference in terms of accepatability of your research when it comes to the question of getting acknowledged by the top-tier community.
<br />
Each student will have to give 20 minutes presentation on a chosen paper, followed by QnA session. The date of presentation will be pre-scheduled (will be annouced shortly; tentatively from the week starting 24th Jan) and once it is annouced, no date change request will be entertained. 
<br />
The paper will be allocated on FCFS basis. The list of papers are available in the [Reading List page](/readinglist/).
